 # Question 5
 
 Imagine that you are trying to write an app that identifies an independent school based on a series of questions.
 
 The questions will be answered for you with either `true` or `false` and no other possible response.
 
 Three constants have been created below with certain values.
 
 Write an `if` statement that prints "Must be Lakefield!" when the values of the constants would seem to suggest the school is Lakefield, or otherwise prints "Hmm, need more data to be sure."
 
 */
let hasWaterfrontOnLake = true
let hasBoysAndGirlsAttending = false
let hasGreenAndWhiteBuildings = true

// Answer question 5 below
if hasWaterfrontOnLake && hasBoysAndGirlsAttending && hasGreenAndWhiteBuildings {
    print("Must be Lakefield!")
} else {
    print("Hmm, need more data to be sure.")
}

// Alternate syntax
if hasWaterfrontOnLake == true && hasBoysAndGirlsAttending == true && hasGreenAndWhiteBuildings == true {
    print("Must be Lakefield!")
} else {
    print("Hmm, need more data to be sure.")
}
